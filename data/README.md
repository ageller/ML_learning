# Description of the data

- google_kaggle.csv : downloaded from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/varpit94/google-stock-data)
- Google_marketwatch.csv : downloaded (1 year at a time) from MarketWatch [here](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/goog/download-data?startDate=3/25/2024&endDate=12/16/2024) to add data through Dec. 2024.

I then combined these with a simple python script here.
